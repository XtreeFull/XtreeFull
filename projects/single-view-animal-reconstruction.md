# Master Project - Single-view animal reconstruction

**Project Duration:** Feb. 2025 - Present

## Description

This project involves enhancing an existing model for reconstructing 3D dog meshes from a single monocular image. The aim is to improve the accuracy and fidelity of the 3D reconstructions.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

* **Model Enhancement:** I am tasked with improving an existing 3D reconstruction model.
* **Feature Integration:** I have integrated DINOv2 features to provide the model with a better semantic understanding of the input image.
* **Depth Information:** I have leveraged the DepthPro model to incorporate depth maps, adding another dimension of information for more accurate reconstruction.
* **Backbone Upgrade:** I upgraded the network's ResNet backbone to a more powerful architecture to boost the overall performance of the model.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* PyTorch3D
* DINOv2
* DepthPro
* ResNet (and upgraded backbone)
