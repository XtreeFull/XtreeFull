# Master Project - Idle speed control system of an engine

**Project Duration:** Sep. 2024 - Dec. 2024

## Description

This project involved the development of an idle speed control system for an engine. The project encompassed both simulation and physical implementation.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

* **Engine Dynamics Modeling:** I engineered a comprehensive engine dynamics model using MATLAB and Simulink to analyze and simulate the engine's behavior at idle speed.
* **Control Algorithm Design:** I designed and implemented robust control algorithms for both the simulated model and a physical engine system.

## Technologies Used

* MATLAB
* Simulink
