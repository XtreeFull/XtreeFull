# Master Project - Human mesh recovery from egocentric depth images

**Project Duration:** Apr. 2025 - Present

## Description

The goal of this project is to improve an existing pose detection framework for human mesh recovery from egocentric depth images.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

* **Framework Improvement:** I have enhanced the existing framework by replacing its ResNet backbone with the more advanced ConvNeXt architecture.
* **Depth and Discriminator Integration:** I have integrated depth information from the EgoBody dataset and introduced a discriminator to refine the accuracy of the generated mesh.
* **Diffusion Model Implementation:** I have implemented a diffusion model to further enhance the final mesh recovery from monocular images, leading to more realistic and detailed results.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* PyTorch3D
* ConvNeXt
* EgoBody Dataset
* Diffusion Models
