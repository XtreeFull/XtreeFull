# Semester Thesis - Self Sensing Robot Link

**Project Duration:** Mar. 2025 - Present

## Description

This project focuses on the design and prototyping of a novel robotic link with integrated force-sensing capabilities. The goal is to create a more intelligent and responsive robotic component that can sense and react to its environment in real-time.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

* **Design and Prototyping:** I am responsible for the complete design and prototyping process of the robotic link, from initial concept to a functional prototype.
* **Force-Sensing Integration:** The core of this project is the integration of force-sensing technology directly into the robotic link.
* **Object Detection and Tracking:** I am implementing object detection and tracking algorithms to enable the robotic link to accurately estimate applied normal and shear forces.

## Technologies Used

* *Please specify the technologies you are using for this project, e.g., CAD software, specific sensors, programming languages, libraries, etc.*
