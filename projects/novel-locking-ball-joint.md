# Bachelor Thesis: Novel High-Torque Locking Ball Joint

For my bachelor's thesis, I single-handedly designed, prototyped, and validated a novel, high-performance locking ball joint for robotics. The project addressed a critical weakness in modern robotics: the inability of most robotic joints to withstand high torques, which limits their use in demanding applications.

### The Challenge

Most locking ball joints used in research for applications like wearable or walking robots are surprisingly weak, often failing at torques below 1 Nm. This severely limits their real-world utility. The challenge was to engineer a new, compact, and efficient locking ball joint from the ground up that could dramatically outperform these existing solutions.

The primary design goals were:
* **High Holding Torque:** Withstand over 10 Nm for a plastic prototype and project to over 250 Nm for a steel version.
* **Fast & Efficient Actuation:** Lock and unlock quickly with minimal power consumption.
* **Compactness & Simplicity:** Ensure the design was small, lightweight, and easy to maintain.

### My Design Process & Solution

After analyzing existing concepts, I chose a mechanical, gear-based locking mechanism as the most promising path for high torque resistance. My design process was highly iterative, starting with an initial concept prototype.

From this starting point, I systematically prototyped and evaluated four different actuation mechanisms (Solenoid/Spring, Servo/Lead Screw, Pneumatic, DC Motor) before selecting a **non-captive pancake stepper motor**. This choice provided the best combination of compact size, high precision, and crucial safety features. I also solved critical design challenges like the "drawer effect" (self-wedging) and performed force calculations using the **Lewis Form Factor** to ensure the gear teeth could withstand extreme loads.

### Key Achievements

* **Engineered a prototype that achieved ~20 Nm of holding torque**â€”over **40 times stronger** than comparable academic designs which were limited to less than 0.5 Nm.
* **Designed for extreme efficiency**, requiring **200 times less actuation torque** (10 Nmm vs. 4 Nm) to engage than an equivalent commercial steel joint.
* **Projected industrial-grade performance**, calculating a theoretical holding torque of **over 700 Nm** for a CNC-machined steel version based on material properties and force analysis.
* **Conducted a rigorous, iterative design process**, systematically prototyping and testing multiple actuation systems and tooth geometries to find the optimal configuration.
* **Authored a comprehensive 40-page thesis** detailing the entire research, design, and validation process.
