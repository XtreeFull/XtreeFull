# Bachelor Thesis - Novel Locking Ball Joint

**Project Duration:** Feb. 2024 - Jul. 2024

## Description

For my Bachelor Thesis, I conceptualized, designed, and prototyped a novel locking ball joint for advanced robotics applications. The primary objective was to significantly improve upon existing designs in terms of holding torque and actuation force.

## Key Achievements

* **Innovative Design:** I developed a new mechanism for a locking ball joint that addresses the limitations of current solutions.
* **Exceptional Performance:** The resulting prototype demonstrated a **40x increase in holding torque** with a **200x lower actuation force** compared to existing designs of the same mass. This represents a significant advancement in the field of robotic joint technology.
