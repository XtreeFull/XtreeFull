## About Me

I am a highly motivated Mechatronics Engineer with a strong foundation in mechanical design, finite element analysis (FEA), and control systems. I am proficient in a variety of CAD and FEM software, and I have hands-on experience in both academic and industrial settings. I am also an experienced programmer with skills in C++ and Python, and I am particularly interested in the application of deep learning in computer vision, as demonstrated in my recent projects.
